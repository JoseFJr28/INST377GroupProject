# Let Them Cook!

### “Let Them Cook!” is a website created by Simon Miller and Jose Fuentes Jr. that helps solve the problem related to knowing what is inside the foods consumers purchase. Nutrition labels can be overwhelming and often confusing for the consumer to read. This website will help simplify the process of knowing what exactly is in food that can be hazardous and/or unhealthy to consumers. Namely, allergens. The wesbite also has a coffee slideshow and a contact page.
